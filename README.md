# Dynamic Graph Collaborative Filtering on Bipartite Graphs using Graph Convolutional Networks

This work extends the Graph Convolutional Collaborative Filtering (GCCF) framework proposed by Kim and Kim (2022) to include temporal adaptability for evolving recom-
mendation scenarios. Hence making it a Dynamic Graph Collaborative filtering model
